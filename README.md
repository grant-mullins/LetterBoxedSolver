# NOTE: LetterBoxedSolver no longer works after NYT added a paywall to Letter Boxed.

LetterBoxedSolver is a CLI tool written in Python. It finds all two-word solutions to NYT's Letter Boxed puzzle, then ranks these solutions based on the rarity of the words. It also allows for searching these solutions to see if you're close to finding one yourself.
